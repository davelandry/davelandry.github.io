    Final presentations will be April 18 (in 2 weeks). Be prepared to stand in front of the class, demo your project, and talk about what you've learned.
  </p>
  <p>
    You have until April 25, the following Thursday, to make any final changes based on feedback. I will be sitting down to grade everyone's final at that time.
