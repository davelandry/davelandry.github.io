  <p>
    Next week's class will be strictly presentations. Be prepared to stand in front of the class, demo your project, and talk about what you've learned.
  </p>
  <p>
    You have until April 25 at 6pm to make any final changes based on feedback. I will be sitting down at that time to grade everyone's project.
